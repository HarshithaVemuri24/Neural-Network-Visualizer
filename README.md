# Neural-Network-Visualizer
Designed and implemented a Neural Network Visualizer web application using Python, Streamlit, Keras, and Flask. This application facilitates the visualization of various layers within a neural network, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of neural networks.

The lighter the color of a block, the higher the probability that it represents the given number. (In this case 9 and 4 are lighter than others but 4 is even lighter than 9. So the predisted value is '4'.

As seen, the predicted number and input number matches.
